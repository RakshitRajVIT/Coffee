# RynShit Co.  
*Crafted with Passion*  
Web Portfolio of Rakshit Raj

## 🚀 Overview  
RynShit Co. is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and the creative approach I bring to software engineering and AI/ML. It reflects not only what I build, but *how* I think — combining clean design, efficient code, and meaningful content.

## 🔍 Features  
- **Responsive Design** — Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- **Modern Tech Stack** — Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (with frameworks/libraries if used).  
- **Projects Section** — Highlights of selected projects with descriptions, links, and visuals.  
- **About & Skills** — A personal section that outlines my background, specializations (AI & ML), and technical competencies.  
- **Contact / Social Links** — Easy access to connect: email, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.  
- **Clean UI & UX** — Minimal aesthetic, intuitive navigation, fast load times.

## 🎯 Why This Website  
As a B.Tech (CSE, AI/ML) student at VIT Bhopal, I believe a portfolio is not just a list of projects—it’s a story. This website is my story in web form: the problems I’ve solved, the tools I’ve mastered, and the journey I’m on. It also serves as a live demo of my front‑end/web‑development skills.

## 📦 Tech Stack  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, Media Queries)  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Hosted on Netlify ([rynshitco.netlify.app](https://rynshitco.netlify.app/))
